# Real-Time Bus Tracker Exercise

This is an exercise where you can clone a repository and learn how to display the live location of a bus tracker on a map. By manipulating the Google Maps API and using JavaScript, you can create a real-time bus tracker that displays the location of a bus on a map.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository onto your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

>git clone https://github.com/OliverStanciu/Real-Time-Bus-Tracking.git

Once you have cloned the repository, open the `06_real-time_bus_tracker.html` file in your preferred code editor and launch it on your default browser.

## Usage

After opening the `06_real-time_bus_tracker.html` file, you will see a map of the Boston area with a marker that displays the location of a bus.

To update the bus's location, click on the "Update Bus Location" button. The marker on the map will move to the bus's current location, which is retrieved from the MBTA API.

Feel free to experiment with different bus routes and see how the marker updates in real-time to display the bus's current location.

## Contributing

This exercise is a great way to learn how to use the Google Maps API and make API calls with JavaScript. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes.
